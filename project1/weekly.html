  1. ARAKAWA <br>
   The purpose of a diagram is meant to be a simplified image of some type of structure. We use diagrams such as Venn Diagrams, or T Diagrams, often when note-taking, to provide a visual representation that can better organize a load of information into a more consumable meaning. However, what I find with Arakawa&#39;s diagrams in The Mechanisms of Meaning is that the surface simplicity of each artwork&#39;s appearance is a facade. Underneath the canvas, onlookers are forced to go one level deeper and consider meanings that are not given. In this aspect, I think that Arakawa is able to incorporate this organized, yet interpretive essence of art very well.

  2. AYN RAND <br>
  Ayn Rand&#39;s philosophy is something that sounds incredibly idealistic from afar and at a close glance. The pursuit of happiness is not a new concept, as has been recorded in the Declaration of Independence, but it is also something that is in a way, a privileged mindset. Societies practice altruism in hopes for it to be returned. I think it can be said that during crises, whether naturally or financially, it is no longer possible for every person to survive on their own. I am not well versed in how the country&#39;s economic system runs, much less globally, so I can only assume that her heavy influence on entrepreneurs developed from her inspirational language in building a new world. As people, who would not want to be involved in the power of creating a utopia, especially if it becomes a part of one&#39;s belief. The moment that I began to doubt Rand&#39;s credentials even more was in the way that her peers commented on her justification of rationality towards an affair. I think there is a kind of paradoxical element in saying that every individual should be able to think and act for oneself, and then expecting everybody to follow that line of order with you. But, all power to Rand&#39;s ideas and to those who have found motivation to act towards their goals from them.

  3. HITO STEYERL <br>
  Hito Steyerl mentions that the speed that digital images travel at not only are a factor to their identities, but also define their value as poor images. Just by the distance they travel, the eyes that they reach, poor images hold a power through sheer exposure; allowing them a solid seat in our viewing culture. The appeal to these images seem to be their accessibility and freedom from high cultured constraints. This way, everybody is included in the production and distribution as it becomes the medium for the people. I think this proves is political value, since free discourse is encouraged to criticise and comment on governmental policies. However, whether or not these critiques are taken seriously is another factor. Materiality manifests in the poor image by reflecting all the generally unintellectual and undesirable traits that are shied away from &quot;high-resolution media&quot;; at least that is what I take from the text. And through reflection, there is a truth displayed in it. That is why it never strays far from mainstream circulation, always changing, always moving.

  5. FOUCAULT <br>
  Foucault sounds like he has thought thoroughly about this surveillance system that dominates our society. And there are many perspectives that I had not seen before, such as the roles we play in maintaining order with media. When hearing of the news or reading articles online of other people&#39;s lives, of our politics, or simply of the general publics&#39; wide range of nonsense comments and responses to these events, we are subsequently absorbing these rules as to create a lightly revealed structure of what is deemed politically correct or appropriate. Maybe it is because I have already submitted to the societal system, but I do not believe that this is as scary as it is made out to be. Yes metaphorically, this life is a prison. Our culture, surrounded by watchful eyes exponentially increased by our digital footprints can simulate a prison. But can that be compared to the actual restriction and stakes faced by prisoners trapped in an institution made to instill the lack of freedom upon them? It&#39;s about the smaller things. These differences are what we cannot take for granted. By the end of the podcast, I wondered if Foucault was indicating that we do not have the power in our hands or that we do if we believe it to be so. It is slightly hopeful, and I also wonder what I will do about it.
